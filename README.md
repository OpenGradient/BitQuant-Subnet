## Introduction

OpenGradient's Quant Subnet implements a decentralized AI framework for quantitative DeFi analysis on the Bittensor network. Through natural language interfaces, it enables:
- ML-powered market analytics
- Portfolio analysis and optimization
- Risk assessment and trend analysis
- Quantitative strategy evaluation

## OpenQuant

The subnet is powered by OpenQuant, OpenGradient's AI agent framework for quantitative analysis that provides:
- Real-time market data processing and insights
- Portfolio analysis and optimization
- Price trend and pattern analysis
- Token metrics and risk evaluation
- Risk-reward assessment

## Architecture

The OG Quant subnet implements a decentralized quantitative analysis framework through three main components:

### Protocol Layer
- Defines the `QuantSynapse` 
- Handles query/response structures through `QuantQuery` and `QuantResponse`
- Manages message validation and serialization
- Provides the `QuantAPI` for standardized network interaction

### Network Nodes

**Miners**
- Process incoming requests through blacklist and priority checks
- Forward validated queries to OpenQuant for processing
- Add response metadata and handle error cases

**Validators**
- Sample random miners for querying
- Forward analysis requests to selected miners
- Calculate response scores through reward function
- Update miner scores in the metagraph

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Bittensor
- Access to compute resources (see `min_compute.yml`)

For detailed setup instructions, see:
- [Local Development](./docs/running_on_staging.md)
- [Testnet Deployment](./docs/running_on_testnet.md)
- [Mainnet Deployment](./docs/running_on_mainnet.md)
