## Setup

### Validator Setup

```bash
# Install Python3.13 and Python3.13 tools on your OS
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.13 python3.13-venv python3.13-dev pkg-config

# Clone BitQuant-Subnet Repository and checkout Validator Branch
git clone https://github.com/OpenGradient/BitQuant-Subnet
cd BitQuant-Subnet
git checkout Validator

# Optional: Create Python Virtual Environment (Best Practice)
python3.13 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# Set up customized environment variables in .env, or fall back to defaults
cp .env.example .env

# Run the Validator with your Bittensor Wallet setup
python neurons/validator.py --netuid 15 --subtensor.network finney --wallet.name validator --wallet.hotkey default --logging.debug
```

### Miner Setup

```bash
# Install Python3.13 and Python3.13 tools on your OS
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.13 python3.13-venv python3.13-dev pkg-config

# Clone BitQuant-Subnet Repository and BitQuant submodule
git clone --branch Miner --recursive https://github.com/OpenGradient/BitQuant-Subnet
cd BitQuant-Subnet

# Optional: Create Python Virtual Environment (Best Practice)
python3.13 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# Setup all the environment variables in .env
cp .env.example .env

# Run the Miner with your Bittensor Wallet setup
python neurons/miner.py --netuid 15 --subtensor.network finney --wallet.name miner --wallet.hotkey default --logging.debug
```

**Note**: Running a miner node requires substantially higher compute requirements due to the local running of the BitQuant agent. Setup instructions can be found https://github.com/OpenGradient/BitQuant

### Troubleshooting FAQ

**Note**: This repository requires Python3.13 and Python3.13 tools

1. **Any 'ModuleNotFoundError'**
   - Make sure you ran both `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `pip install -e .` and `git submodule update --init --recursive`

2. **ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement bittensor==9.2.0**
   - Make sure you're using Python3.13 and you update Pip

## Introduction

OpenGradient's BitQuant Subnet implements a decentralized AI framework for quantitative DeFi analysis on the Bittensor network. Through natural language interfaces, it enables:
- ML-powered market analytics
- Portfolio analysis and optimization
- Risk assessment and trend analysis
- Quantitative strategy evaluation

### High-Level Goals
- Democratize access to advanced quantitative analytics for DeFi and crypto markets
- Incentivize high-quality AI agents to provide real-time, actionable insights
- Enable composable, on-chain quantitative strategies and risk metrics
- Foster a robust ecosystem for decentralized, AI-powered financial intelligence

The subnet is powered by BitQuant, OpenGradient's AI agent framework for quantitative analysis that provides:
- Real-time market data processing and insights
- Portfolio analysis and optimization
- Price trend and pattern analysis
- Token metrics and risk evaluation
- Risk-reward assessment

## BitQuant
BitQuant is an agentic framework for digital asset analytics and DeFi strategy, enabling users to analyze tokens, DeFi pools, and portfolio risk with advanced on-chain and off-chain data.

**Agent Capabilities:**
- Pool Discovery
- Token Search
- TVL Analytics
- Price Trend Analysis
- Drawdown Calculation
- Portfolio Volatility
- Wallet Analytics
- Trending Tokens
- Token Risk Evaluation
- Top Holders Lookup

**Example Queries:**
- "Find all Solana pools I can invest in with my wallet’s tokens and show their historical TVL."
- "Analyze the price trend and calculate the max drawdown for SOL over the last 90 days."
- "Evaluate my wallet’s portfolio volatility and identify the riskiest token holding."
- "Search for trending tokens across X chain and display their top holders."
- "Compare historical global TVL and chain-specific TVL for Ethereum and Solana."

## Architecture

The OG BitQuant subnet implements a decentralized quantitative analysis framework through three main components:

### Protocol Layer
- Defines the `QuantSynapse` 
- Handles query/response structures through `QuantQuery` and `QuantResponse`
- Manages message validation and serialization
- Provides the `QuantAPI` for standardized network interaction

### Network Nodes

**Miners**
- Process incoming requests through blacklist and priority checks
- Forward validated queries to BitQuant for processing
- Add response metadata and handle error cases

**Validators**
- Sample random miners for querying
- Forward analysis requests to selected miners
- Calculate response scores through reward function
- Update miner scores in the metagraph

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13
- Bittensor
- Access to compute resources (see `min_compute.yml`)
